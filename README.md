# Quick setup

â€» If you are using `fvm` for version management, you have to put `fvm` in front of `flutter` commands.

1. Create your own flutter project.
2. Copy `pubspec.yaml` in this repository.
3. Rewrite from `pubspc.yaml` in your project to the `pubspec.yaml` you copied in the last step.
4. Copy `lib/main.dart` in this repository.
5. Rewrite from `lib/main.dart` in your project to the `lib/main.dart` you copied in the last step.
6. Execute `flutter pub get` and `flutter pub run build_runner build -d` to confirm that your setup is correct.
7. Execute `flutter run`
